	The purpose of scoring is to increase the surface area and make it easier for water to reach the interior. The process involves removing a thin layer of concrete using an abrasive diamond-tipped blade, which produces deep parallel grooves in flat or curved surfaces. Scoring can also be used as an aesthetic design element: lines are cut into  the concrete to resemble mortar lines in brick.
